I'm currently a physics student at Sharif University of Technology. In my undergraduate life, I was introduced to Complex Systems and
later to Computational Neuroscience. I am planning to transition to Computational Neuroscience for my higher education.

I am a total geek. I love to code and work with open source projects. I'm a proud Archer if you know what I mean.
I love to customize my working environments to the max. I use Vim and VS Code.

I seek novelty in Computational Neuroscience. I am especially amazed by Brain Computer Interfaces and would love to
work in this area in the future.

You can check out my CV [here](/assets/pdf/ali_mahani_cv.pdf).

## Research Interests
In today's world, we can see Artificial Intelligence and the Machine Learning algorithms finding their way in every industry.
Data-driven companies keep growing day by day and innovating new algorithms that revolutionize the field. But when we compare
these learning algorithms to the learning capacity of human brain, we see some areas are still immature.

Over the years we have tried to simplify neural computations and have put the simulation of human brain as our end goal.
This area of **Bio-inspired Machine Learning** is what I believe to have the most potential as of today. Simulating different neural networks
while retaining some degree of complexity of the neural behavior can lead to better understanding of human brain as a computational machine.\
We have seen instances of bio-inspired algorithms in the past years, like Recurrent Neural Networks or Convolutional Neural Networks.

Another field I find very interesting is **Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI)**. This field helps us develop technology that can lead us to a better
understanding of neural coding and enables us to bridge the silicon-based machines with the carbon-based ones. It can help us develop
more powerful robots, integrate AI and humans.
I am most interested in developing these BCI devices for encoding and decoding neural data.

## Outside Academia
I love playing squash. I started this sport when I was a junior at high school and I play whenever I have free time.

I'm also a project-based Persian-to-English translator at [transnet](https://transnet.ir)

I love to listen to music when I'm driving or programming. I have created playlists for every activity I do.

I like to read novels and occasionally leave a review on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/69194805-ali-abolhassanzadeh-mahani).
