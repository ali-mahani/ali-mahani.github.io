I'm currently a physics student at Sharif University of Technology. In my undergraduate life, I was introduced to Complex Systems and
later to Computational Neuroscience. I am planning to transition to Computational Neuroscience for my higher education.

I am a total geek. I love to code and work with open source projects. I'm a proud Archer if you know what I mean.  :smiley_face:\
I love to customize my working environments to the max. I use Vim and VS Code.

I seek novelty in Computational Neuroscience. I am especially amazed by Brain Computer Interfaces and would love to
work in this area in the future.

## Outside Academia
I love playing squash. I started this sport when I was a junior at high school and I play whenever I have free time.

I'm also a project-based Persian-to-English translator at [transnet](https://transnet.ir)

I love to listen to music when I'm driving or programming. I have created playlists for every activity I do.

I like to read novels and occasionally leave a review on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/69194805-ali-abolhassanzadeh-mahani).
