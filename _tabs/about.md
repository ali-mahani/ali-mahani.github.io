# Ali Abolhassanzadeh Mahani
I'm currently a physics student at Sharif University of Technology. In my undergraduate life, I was introduced to Complex Systems and
later to Computational Neuroscience. I am planning to transition to Computational Neuroscience for my higher education.

I am a total geek. I love to code and work with open source projects. I'm a proud Archer if you know what I mean.  :smiley_face:\
I love to customize my working environments to the max. I use Vim and VS Code.

I seek novelty in Computational Neuroscience. I am especially amazed by Brain Computer Interfaces and would love to
work in this area in the future.
