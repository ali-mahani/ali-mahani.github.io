Hello! This is me! I finally setup my Github-pages and can start writing stuff as I please.

Let's try some Math and code.

First is the Math.\
The Poisson Distribution equation is
\begin{equation}
f(k; \lambda) = \frac{\lambda^{k}e^{-\lambda}}{k!}
\end{equation}

And now a piece of code:
```python
class Human:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "Ali A. Mahani"
        self.birthday = "Feb. 25"
        self.hobbies = ["Squash", "Billiard", "Guitar"]

    def say_hi(self):
        print(f"Hi everyone! I'm {self.name}. I like {x + ", " for x in self.hobbies}.")

me = Human()
me.say_hi()
``````

Now we can go one our lives... Have fun :)
